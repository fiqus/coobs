        <h3>1. Create a period</h3>
        <p>
          To start adding cooperative actions based on principles, it is necessary to previously create a period.
          The period is a time window that marks the beginning and the end of the year of the cooperative's activities, which is generally defined by the balance held annually.
          To manage the periods of the cooperative, it is necessary to go to "Configuration => Periods".
          In there you can add, modify and delete organization's periods.
          When adding and editing periods, bear in mind that they cannot overlap.
          Besides, when configuring a period, it is important to indicate a monetary budget. This budget will help us to monitor its execution throughout the year.
          The representation of this budget may vary, however, the original idea that gave place to this attribute within the period is the cooperative promotion fund that cooperatives have under Argentine legislation.

        <p>
          Coobs seeks to involve all the people belonging to the organization.
          The idea is that the people who make up the cooperative upload the actions that the organization carries out throughout the year in an organic way.
          To do so, they must first have an user. This is why there is a specific section to manage the members.
          To access this section, go to "Configuration => Associated persons". When creating an associated person we must setup, among other things, a password.
          It is important to ask him/her to modify it after the first login, so that he/she has a personal and secure password.
          After adding a person to the organization, the platform will send him/her an e-mail informing that he/she has been added and his/her login will be enabled.

        <h3>4. Cooperative principles</h3>
        <p>
          Cooperative principles are the ones that guide the organization actions.
          All actions we take as cooperative organizations should be framed under these principles.
          This is why the principles allow us to group the actions we create in the platform. Each action can refer to multiple principles.
          In the principles list we will be able to see their description, to have a better understanding of in which case they should be used and to which type of actions they should be attributed.
          One of the functionalities to highlight related to the principles, is that surely our cooperative is not equally impacted by all of them, which is why the principles can be marked as "not visible" so that they do not appear as principles to be imputed in our actions. As they are not visible, they do not appear in the control panel.
          This is done mainly to facilitate the usability of creating actions and monitoring the control panel, showing only those principles that we are interested in measuring as cooperative.

        <h3>1. Actions creation</h3>
        <p>
          Actions represent the main measurement object of the platform. They reflect the concrete work of our organization and will impact the indicators of the related cooperative principles.
          To load the actions it is necessary to go, within the main menu, to the "Actions" option. There we have several applicable filters to facilitate the search for them. To begin the adding process, go to the "Add" action option.
          Once inside the action form, we will be able to setup a title that represents the action, a description and to assign the following attributes:
        </p>
        <div class="help-step-desc">
          <h4>Principle</h4>
          <p>
            More than one can be selected. It may be that an action is comprehensive enough to impact more than one principle.
          </p>

          <h4>Associates</h4>
          <p>
            In case we want to keep a personal follow-up of the actions performed, we can assign people to the actions.
          </p>

          <h4>Start date</h4>
          <p>
            You can indicate on which date the action took place. If the action took more than one day (such as an event), only the event's start date is indicated.
            In addition, you can load actions that have already taken place or actions that are going to take place. The idea of adding actions that are going to happen is to be able to plan the annual participation of our cooperative in terms of cooperative actions.
          </p>

          <h4>Invested hours</h4>
          <p>
            Actions generally involve invested work. This work can be measured in hours, in this way we can account the amount of effort that is dedicated to a certain type of actions.
          </p>

          <h4>Invested amount</h4>
          <p>
            In addition to the invested hours, we will be able to indicate if money was dedicated to an action.
            This is particularly useful in cases where we have a budget set aside for cooperative actions, as might be the case with the cooperative promotion fund.
            Each action that has an allocated amount, will subtract the amount from the cooperative's available amount (or budget) indicated in the period in question.
            In this way we will be able to keep track of the annual budget set aside for our organization's social actions.
          </p>

          <h4>Public or private action attribute</h4>
          <p>
            This status allows us to indicate whether we give the platform permission to share that action to the rest of the cooperatives or in public sections, in order to communicate and make visible the actions that our cooperative carries out.
            In case we do not want the action to have a public visibility status, we must select the "private" option and in this way only our cooperative will be able to see that action.

        <h3>2. Follow-up of cooperative actions</h3>
        <p>
          One of the main functionalities of the platform is action tracking.
          Within the "Panel" option in the main menu, we will be able to see the following indicators:</p>
        <div class="help-step-desc">
          <h4>Principle</h4>
          <p>
            Period selector: The period can be changed in order to be able to make a comparison between the different years in which the tool was used.
            When choosing a different period, the platform will display the control panel related to the period in question.
            By default, the current period will be selected.
          </p>
          <h4>Counter of actions performed and to be performed</h4>
          <p>
            It shows the sum of the actions performed (past) and to be performed (future).
            In this way we can visualize the balance between what was planned and what we have already done.
          </p>
          <h4>Total amount invested in actions</h4>
          <p>
            It represents the sum of the invested amount of all the actions, past and future, that are present on the platform.
          </p>
          <h4>Percentage of total invested amount</h4>
          <p>
            This is the total amount invested compared to the budget initially set for the selected period.
            By following this indicator, we will be able to observe how the amounts dedicated to cooperative actions impact and where we are in relation to the defined budget.
            It is important to clarify that the amounts of future actions do have an impact on this calculation, so that a complete planning can be carried out and thus ensure the budget execution dedicated to actions.
          </p>
          <h4>Actions stock pie chart</h4>
          <p>
            Here you can see the proportions of the actions in relation to the principles.
            It allows us to see to which principle we are dedicating more actions.
            Another way of asking the same question would be: In which principle my organization is "stronger"?
          </p>
          <h4>Progress</h4>
          <p>
            In this section we will see the same information but from a forward-looking perspective.
          </p>
          <h4>Period</h4>
          <p>
            It allows us to visualize the level of progress of the current period: Has it just started? Is it about to end?
          </p>
          <h4>Actions</h4>
          <p>
            It allows us to visualize a comparison between past and future actions.
            That is, of all the added actions, what level of completeness do they have? Are there more planned than performed?
          </p>
          <h4>Invested amount in relation to the period's total budget amount</h4>
          <p>
            It is similar to the "Promotion Fund" chart, with the difference that it shows the values and not percentages.
          </p>
          <h4>Invested hours by date</h4>
          <p>
            To show the invested workload in actions.
          </p>
          <h4>Investment per month</h4>
          <p>
            Shows the total amount invested in actions month by month.
          </p>
          <h4>All the principles</h4>
          <p>
            It shows in a bar chart, month by month, the percentage per month of actions related to principles.
            In this way we can identify to which principle we dedicate more actions per month throughout the period.

          <p>
            If there are actions loaded on the platform in which I, as a person associated to the cooperative, appear as a participant,
            then I will be able to track them in a similar way to the one that can be done in the control panel, but with a filter applied that will show me only those in which I participated.
            To see your statistics, you must access to the "My statistics" option in the main menu.
            Once there, I will only see the metrics of the actions in which I participated.

            There you will find all the actions listed, each one with its description and the number of invested hours and amount.
            The actions are grouped by principle and each principle can be expanded or collapsed in order to have a cleaner view of the actions present within a principle.

          When you change the period, the platform will show you the balance corresponding to the selected period.
          The default value is the current period.
          It is important to mention that by changing the period selector in this section, the information will change only in this screen and not in other sections, i.e. it does not change the information status in the control panel.
